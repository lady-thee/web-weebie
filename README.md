## Introduction
👋 Hi, I’m @lady-thee, a young zodiac goddess itching to become a master at programming. I am a brown girl, with brown eyes and brown eyes. 
I wear glasses to see my laptop and I love them. I love to read, watch TikTok videos in my spare time. I also love being Sherlock and figuring out why stuff works the way it does. 

## What I'm Interested In 👀
I am interested in becoming a Software engineer. It's a hectic road but I'm up for the challenge. 

## My Current Stack 🌱
Currently, I am mastering the secrets of Django, the web framework of Python. 

## 💞️ Can I collaborate? 
Why, yes! Of course, I wanna work with you, I can only grow to be a goddess of programming if I work with people to build more interesting objects. I hope we get to work together! 💞️💞️
